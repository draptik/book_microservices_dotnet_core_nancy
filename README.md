Notes on the book [Microservices in .NET Core
with examples in Nancy](https://www.manning.com/books/microservices-in-net-core).

All code examples for the book are located at: [https://github.com/horsdal/microservices-in-dotnetcore](https://github.com/horsdal/microservices-in-dotnetcore)

Don't waste time if the templating engine `yo` does not work as described in the book! Just create the files manually or adopt the files from the github repo provided by the author of the book.

All code examples use the json format. Microsoft has decided to go back to xml (but, at least the new csproj format has improved).
